				Lets talk about waterfall, yeah, the bad boy in town, the one everybody
				hates. Waterfall in The main idea is:
			</Text>
			<Text>
				1- We get the requirements, what we want to do, the stakeholders needs.
				<br />
				2- You plan how to do it, often comes with an analysis and design of the
				solution.
				<br />
				3- You implement it, creating working software.
				<br />
				4- You deliver the software and wait for feedback, creating
				documentation during the process.
				<br />
				5- Maintenance of the working solution. Once we deliver the solution, we
				ask for feedback and if we need to touch anything, we start the process
				all over again.

				This is awesome as long as the requirements are super stable and we know
				they will not change during implementation, something that in the real
				world is practically impossible as they are ALWAYS changing. If we were
				a fabric we wouldnt have any of these issues, as we know the specific
				required materials to create something, we put them in the machine, and
				the result is always going to be the same. But we work with software
				solutions to meet peoples needs, and these are always changing,
				evolving. Here comes the biggest problem with the waterfall methodology.
				We have to wait until the end of the implementation to receive feedback
				and then start the whole process again, so what if the user needs have
				changed in the meantime ? Weve just wasted a lot of useful time.
