# Applying Clean Architecture in the Front End

Hey folks! Today we are going to talk about how to bring Clean Architecture to
the front end, but with a special twist. We will see how we can do it in a more
organic and flexible way, without overly rigid folder structures, and how the
scope rule plays a fundamental role in all of this. Join me on this journey
through a more natural and adaptable approach!

## Key Concepts of Clean Architecture

The idea behind Clean Architecture is to decouple software from UI technologies,
databases, and any other external elements, focusing on pure business logic.
This is achieved through layers that clearly separate responsibilities:

- **Domain:** Here we define our entities and business rules that are completely
  independent of the user interface and external technologies. These are the
  fundamental concepts on which the application is built.

- **Use Cases:** Responsible for implementing the business logic necessary to
  meet the functional requirements of the system. They operate on the domain
  model and use adapters to communicate with the infrastructure layer.

- **Adapters:** Connect use cases with the outside world, either by presenting
  data to the user or communicating with a database.

- **Frameworks and Drivers:** This is the outermost layer, where we interact
  directly with specific frameworks and libraries.

### Example

For the example of a banking application where the business requirement is that
only people over 18 years old can register, we will design a structure following
the principles of Clean Architecture. This structure will ensure that business
rules, such as the age restriction, are clearly defined and decoupled from the
user interface and other external components.

### Proposed Structure for the Banking Application

Let's imagine how we could organize our project into the layers suggested by
Clean Architecture:

#### Domain, Entities Models and Business Rules

Here we define the `User` model, which includes attributes such as name, date of
birth, address, etc. Additionally, this layer will contain business rules, such
as verifying the age of majority.

- User.js

  ```javascript
  class User {
    constructor(name, dateOfBirth) {
      this.name = name;
      this.dateOfBirth = dateOfBirth;
    }

    isAdult() {
      const today = new Date();
      const age = today.getFullYear() - this.dateOfBirth.getFullYear();
      return age >= 18;
    }
  }
  ```

- UserBusinessRules.js

  ```javascript
  function validateUser(user) {
    return user.isAdult();
  }
  ```

#### Use Cases

This layer contains the specific logic that implements the functional
requirements, using the domain entities. In our case, a use case would be
"Register User".

- RegisterUser.js

  ```javascript
  class RegisterUser {
    constructor(userRepository, user) {
      this.userRepository = userRepository;
      this.user = user;
    }

    execute() {
      if (validateUser(this.user)) {
        this.userRepository.add(this.user);
        return true;
      } else {
        throw new Error("User must be at least 18 years old");
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### Interface Adapters

These adapters will include controllers and presenters that interact with the
domain layer and transform data for the UI or external services.

- UserAdapter.js

  ```javascript
  class UserAdapter {
    static toDTO(user) {
      return {
        name: user.name,
        dateOfBirth: user.dateOfBirth.toISOString().split("T")[0],
      };
    }
  }
  ```

#### Frameworks and Drivers

Here is where specific technology details such as React components for the UI,
route configuration, and services that interact with databases or external APIs
are implemented.

- UserComponent.js (React Component)

  ```javascript
  import React, { useState } from "react";

  function UserComponent({ onSubmit }) {
    const [name, setName] = useState("");
    const [dateOfBirth, setDateOfBirth] = useState("");

    const handleSubmit = () => {
      const user = new User(name, new Date(dateOfBirth));
      onSubmit(user);
    };

    return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
        <input
          type="date"
          value={dateOfBirth}
          onChange={(e) => setDateOfBirth(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Register</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
  ```

- App.js (Setting up the application)

  ```javascript
  import React from "react";
  import UserComponent from "./UserComponent";
  import UserRepository from "./UserRepository";

  function App() {
    const userRepository = new UserRepository();

    const handleUserSubmit = (user) => {
      try {
        const registerUser = new RegisterUser(userRepository, user);
        registerUser.execute();
        alert("User registered successfully!");
      } catch (error) {
        alert(error.message);
      }
    };

    return <UserComponent onSubmit={handleUserSubmit} />;
  }
  ```

### Organic Approach to Folder Structure

Unlike traditional approaches that structure folders very rigidly from the
start, I prefer a more organic approach. The idea is to allow the project
structure to evolve naturally as requirements grow and change. I don't like
over-structuring folders because I believe the structure should emerge from the
needs of the project and the team, not the other way around.

## Introduction to the Scope Rule

The scope rule is essential in this organic approach. It defines how we organize
and reuse components based on their visibility and use within the application:

- **Components in Root:** These are components and services that are accessible
  and reusable throughout the entire application. For example, generic UI
  components or authentication services that are needed in multiple parts of the
  system.

- **Components in Specific Functionalities:** Located in specific containers or
  modules, these components are only used within a particular context or
  functionality. They are perfect for applying lazy loading, as they are only
  loaded when the corresponding functionality is needed.

### Applying Clean Architecture with the Scope Rule

Here's how we can apply these principles together to build a robust and
maintainable front-end application:

1. **Clearly Define the Domain Model:** We start by defining our domain model in
   an agnostic way, without worrying about the UI or infrastructure.

2. **Develop Use Cases:** We implement the business logic in the form of use
   cases, which manipulate the domain model and communicate with adapters.

3. **Implement Adapters Flexibly:** We use adapters to connect our use cases
   with specific user interface components and external services. This is where
   we apply the scope rule to decide whether a component is global or
   module-specific.

4. **Use Lazy Loading to Improve Performance:** We lazily load specific
   functionality modules or containers as needed, which is easily managed
   through routing in modern frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.

Let's expand on how each module or functionality in the front end can be
organized to clearly reflect its purpose and internal structure, following the

philosophy of Clean Architecture and the scope rule we discussed.

### Modular Structure by Functionality

In a front-end development approach based on Clean Architecture, each feature or
functionality of the application is organized into its own folder, named exactly
after the feature it represents. This structure not only facilitates code
navigation and understanding but also effectively encapsulates functionality.

#### Container Component

Within each functionality folder, a main component is created that carries the
same name as the folder. This component acts as a "container" and has two main
responsibilities:

1. **Presentation Structure:** Defines how components are structured and
   displayed on the screen. This container determines the layout and visual
   composition of child components that form the specific functionality's
   interface.

2. **Business Logic and Data Retrieval:** Integrates the business logic relevant
   to the layout, managing the necessary state, and performing operations to
   obtain data from the domain entities. This includes interacting with services
   to retrieve or send data to external sources.

#### Specific Functionality Components

Each component within the functionality folder handles its specific
functionality. These components are designed to be as autonomous as possible,
interacting with the domain entities and applying the relevant business rules.
Their modular and well-defined design facilitates reuse and maintenance.

#### Services and Adapters

Services are used by components to communicate with external entities, such as
backends or APIs. These services generally reside in their own subfolder within
the functionality module and are responsible for sending and receiving data to
and from the outside.

Adapters, on the other hand, are also found in a folder called `adapters` within
the module. Their function is to map data between the format expected by
external services and the format used by domain entities. This bidirectional
mapping ensures that data can be exchanged smoothly and coherently, respecting
the abstractions imposed by the architecture.

### Implementation Conclusion

Organizing each functionality into its own module, with a container component
managing presentation and associated logic, along with specific components
handling more granular details, creates a highly modular and scalable system.
This structure not only improves code readability and maintainability but also
optimizes performance through techniques like lazy loading, loading only the
necessary modules when required by the user.

Implementing Clean Architecture in the front end with this detailed and
organized approach prepares the ground for robust, maintainable, and adaptable
applications, capable of evolving and expanding with business and market needs.

### What is the Container Pattern?

The container pattern, also known in some circles as the "Container Pattern," is
a software architecture technique that involves encapsulating or grouping
several related elements within the same module or container. This container
acts as a logical boundary that defines the autonomy and responsibility over a
specific portion of the application's functionality.

### Container Pattern Structure

Let's imagine we are working on a web application. In a traditional approach,
you might have all your components, business logic, and service calls scattered
throughout the project. In contrast, with the container pattern, you organize
these elements into logical groups that reflect their functions within the
application.

For example, if we have a section of the application dedicated to user
management, we might have a folder structure like this under a `UserManagement`
directory:

```bash
UserManagement/
├── components/
│   ├── UserProfile.js
│   ├── UserList.js
├── hooks/
│   ├── useUserSearch.js
│   ├── useUserProfile.js
├── models/
│   ├── UserModel.js
├── services/
│   ├── UserService.js
└── UserContainer.js  // This is the main container
```

### How the Container Pattern Works

1. **Encapsulation:** Each container handles its own state and dependencies.
   This means that the user management container handles everything specific to
   that function, from business logic to interacting with the corresponding API.

2. **Independence:** Containers are independent of each other, making
   development, testing, and maintenance easier. If you need to work on user
   management, everything you need is in one place, without having to touch
   other parts of the application.

3. **Reusability:** By encapsulating logic and components coherently, you can
   reuse these containers in different parts of the application or even in
   different projects, as long as the functionality is required.

4. **Integration with Lazy Loading:** When using modern frameworks like React,
   Angular, or Vue, we can lazily load these containers. This means that the
   code related to user management is only loaded when the user accesses that
   specific part of the application, improving performance and initial load
   speed.

### Benefits of the Container Pattern

- **Better Organization:** By having a clear boundary of what code does what,
  readability is improved, and the project structure is simplified.
- **Decoupling:** Reduces cross-dependencies between different parts of the
  application, minimizing the risk of unwanted side effects during updates or
  changes.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates managing the growth of the application. As the
  application grows, you can keep adding containers without significantly
  affecting existing ones.
- **Easier Maintenance:** Updating, testing, or fixing bugs becomes easier
  because everything affecting a functional area is contained within its own
  module.

Implementing the container pattern is like organizing a set of tools into
specific boxes in your workshop; each tool has its place, and you know exactly
where to find what you need for each job. This not only makes your life easier
but also makes the work more efficient and less prone to errors. In software
development, especially in complex applications, adopting this pattern can make
the difference between a manageable project and a constant headache.

So go ahead, try it out and see how it transforms your workflow!

Adopting Clean Architecture in our projects not only improves code quality but
also prepares us to grow and adapt easily to new demands and technologies.
Implementing techniques like lazy loading and the container pattern ensures a
robust, maintainable, and efficient application.

## Example with Everything Learned

Sure! Let's dive into how we could structure a practical example using Clean
Architecture in the front end, applying the concept of modules and containers we
discussed. Suppose we are building an e-commerce application that includes
functionalities like listing products, adding products to the cart, and making
payments.

### Example Folder Structure for an E-commerce Application

The following folder structure reflects how we might organize the application's
code:

```bash
src/
└── products/
    ├── ProductsContainer.js     // Container for the product listing
    ├── components/
    │   ├── ProductList.js       // Displays the product list
    │   └── ProductItem.js       // Displays an individual product
    ├── services/
    │   ├── ProductService.js    // Communicates with the API to fetch products
    └── adapters/
        └── ProductAdapter.js    // Adapts product data for the view
└── cart/
    ├── CartContainer.js         // Container for the shopping cart
    ├── components/
    │   ├── CartView.js          // Main view of the cart
    │   └── CartItem.js          // Component for an individual item in the cart
    ├── services/
    │   ├── CartService.js       // Manages the logic for adding/removing items from the cart
    └── adapters/
        └── CartAdapter.js       // Adapts cart data for the view
└── checkout/
    ├── CheckoutContainer.js     // Container for the checkout process
    ├── components/
    │   ├── PaymentForm.js       // Form for payment details
    │   └── OrderSummary.js      // Order summary before purchase
    ├── services/
    │   ├── PaymentService.js    // Processes payments
    └── adapters/
        └── PaymentAdapter.js    // Adapts payment data to be sent to the API
```

### Implementation Details

#### Containers:

- **ProductsContainer.js:** This file would be responsible for loading the
  products from the service, managing any state related to displaying the
  products, and passing the necessary data to the components for display.
- **CartContainer.js:** Manages the shopping cart state, including added
  products, selected quantities, and communication with services to update the
  cart.
- **CheckoutContainer.js:** Controls the checkout process flow, including
  collecting payment information and completing the purchase.

#### Components:

- Each component, such as `ProductList.js`, `CartItem.js`, and `PaymentForm.js`,
  handles the application logic and use cases, bridging the entities with the
  business rules.

#### Services and Adapters:

- **ProductService.js, CartService.js, and PaymentService.js** interact with
  external APIs to send and receive data.
- Adapters like **ProductAdapter.js and PaymentAdapter.js** transform the data
  received from the API into a format that the components can use more
  efficiently and vice versa.

### Benefits of this Structure

- **Modularity:** Each application functionality is self-contained with its own
  set of logic and presentation, facilitating maintainability and scalability.
- **Reusability:** Components within each module can be reused in different
  parts of the application if needed.
- **Maintenance:** Updating or fixing bugs in a specific part of the application
  is easier because the affected code is isolated.
- **Performance:** With techniques like lazy loading, only the necessary
  resources are loaded when they are actually needed, which can significantly
  improve the application's load time.
